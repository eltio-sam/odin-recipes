        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Meet your new favourite mushroom recipe! Rice infused with earthy mushroom flavour tossed through with caramelised mushrooms, this Mushroom Rice is worthy of being a meal by itself.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2-3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>30g / 2 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>750g / 1.5 lb mushroom</li>
            <li>2 garlic gloves</li>
            <li>1 small onion</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups long grain rice, uncooked</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cup vegetable stock / broth</li>
            <li>1 1/2 - 2 cups geen onions</li>
            <li>Optional: more butter to stir through</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large pot over high heat. Add half the mushrooms, and cook for 5 minutes until golden. Season with salt and pepper then remove and set aside (we put these in at the end, mushrooms cooked in rice don't stay as golden).</li>
            <li>If the pot is dry, another 1/2 - 1 tbsp oil, and add butter. When melted, add onions and garlic.</li>
            <li>Cook for 30 seconds, then add remaining mushrooms. Cook for 5 minutes or until mushrooms are lightly browned (they won't caramelise as well as the first batch) and the base of the pot is brown.</li>
            <li>Add rice and a splash of broth. Mix so the brown stuff on the bottom of the pot mixes into the liquid.</li>
            <li>Once the base of the pot is clean, add remaining liquid. Place lid on, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium low.</li>
            <li>Cook for 15 minutes or until there is no residual liquid (tilt pot to check).</li>
            <li>Remove from stove, remove lid, QUICKLY toss in reserved mushrooms and scallions, put lid back on. Leave for 10 minutes (do not skip this step!).</li>
            <li>Fluff rice using a fork or wooden spoon. OPTIONAL: Stir through more butter. Serve!</li>
        </ol>
