        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds small-to-medium red or yellow potatoes</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon plus ¼ teaspoon fine sea salt, divided</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, chives and/or green onion</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>To prepare the potatoes, scrub them clean if dirty and rinse under running water. Remove and discard any nubby sprouting areas. Place the potatoes in a large Dutch oven or soup pot.</li>
            <li>Fill the pot with water until the potatoes are submerged and covered by 1 inch of additional water. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat and continue cooking until the potatoes are very easily pierced through by a fork (smaller potatoes are done around 20 minutes, and medium around 25 minutes).</li>
            <li>While the potatoes cook, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and drizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over a large, rimmed baking sheet. Brush the oil so it’s evenly distributed over the sheet.</li>
            <li>When the potatoes are done, drain them in a large colander and let them cool for about 5 minutes, until they can be handled safely.</li>
            <li>Evenly distribute the potatoes over the prepared baking sheet, and use a potato masher or a serving fork to gently smash each potato to a height of about ½ inch. (Thinner potatoes are more crispy.)</li>
            <li>Drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the smashed potatoes. Sprinkle the garlic powder, onion powder and remaining ¼ teaspoon salt over the potatoes. Finally, sprinkle them lightly with freshly ground black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake until the potatoes are nice and golden on the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle them with chopped fresh herbs, and serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
